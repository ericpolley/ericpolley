          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
          <strong>I've been busy!</strong>
          <br /><br />
          As a self-taught software developer, I have always been on the lookout for new and exciting ways to challenge myself and improve my skills. Recently, I discovered Ursina, a game engine built on top of Panda3D and written in Python. I have been using it to create a game demo, which I plan to release for free on my website.
          <br /><br />
The process of creating a game using Ursina has been a great exercise in learning Python, a programming language that I had always been interested in but never had the opportunity to work with. Python is a versatile language that is well-suited for a wide range of tasks, from web development to data analysis. However, I found that using it to create a game was a particularly enjoyable and engaging way to learn.
<br /><br />
One of the things that I appreciate about Ursina is how easy it is to get started. The engine comes with a number of built-in tools and features that make it easy to create and prototype game ideas. For example, the built-in physics engine allows for realistic movement and collision detection, and the built-in entities and components system makes it easy to create and manage different types of game objects. Additionally, Ursina is built on top of Panda3D, which is a well-established and widely used game engine, so there is a wealth of resources and tutorials available online.
<br /><br />
As I progressed with my game development, I found that Ursina was also a great way to improve my skills in other areas. For example, working with Ursina helped me to develop a better understanding of 3D math, which is a fundamental concept in game development. Additionally, the process of creating a game also helped me to improve my problem-solving skills, as I had to find creative solutions to a variety of technical challenges.
<br /><br />
Overall, I am very excited about the game demo that I am creating using Ursina. I believe that it will be a great addition to my portfolio, and I look forward to sharing it with others. As a self-taught software developer, I am always on the lookout for new and exciting ways to challenge myself and improve my skills, and I believe that Ursina has provided me with a great opportunity to do just that.
<br /><br />
It's also great that my game development experience will compliment my abilities with React.js, javascript, and web development in the future. I am looking forward to using the skills I learned in game development and apply them to web development. As a developer, being able to work with different technologies and programming languages is always a plus.
<br /><br />
In conclusion, my experience with Ursina and game development has been a great opportunity for me to learn and improve my skills as a self-taught software developer. I am excited to share my game demo with others, and I look forward to using the skills I have learned to continue to grow and develop as a developer.

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
          <strong>I started learning Python!</strong>
          <br /><br />
          I work as a self-taught software developer at In The Zone, and I'm constantly looking for fresh, interesting ways to grow my abilities. I've recently been concentrating on learning Python, and I've been using a variety of tools to aid me in my endeavor.
          <br /><br />
          I recorded another vlog a few days ago, which marked the 6-month anniversary of my journey to learn Python. Over the past 6 months, I've been using freecodecamp, chatGPT, YouTube videos, and Google to help me learn the language. I've also been experimenting with different frameworks and libraries, such as tkinter and pyglet.
          <br /><br />
In the past, I've also used turtle for some simple projects, but I've found that pygame doesn't seem to be working for me. The website is even down, which is unfortunate, but it led me to discover other frameworks that work in a similar way. I've decided to focus on using pyglet for now.
<br /><br />
One of the things I've found most challenging about learning Python is figuring out the best way to approach a problem. There are so many different libraries and frameworks available, and it can be difficult to know which one to use. But by experimenting with different options, I've been able to get a better sense of what works best for me.
<br /><br />
As I continue to learn and improve my skills in Python, I plan on recording tutorials on other languages and frameworks, such as JavaScript and React.js. I think that by sharing my experience and knowledge, I can help others who are just getting started on their own learning journey.
<br /><br />
Overall, it's been a challenging and exciting journey, but I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a software developer. I believe that with a little bit of perseverance, anyone can learn to code and become a great developer. If you're just getting started, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things - you never know what you might discover!

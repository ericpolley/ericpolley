        <p>
        Eric Polley was born in Portland, Oregon and spent his childhood moving around a lot. Despite the frequent changes in location, Eric always had a passion for creativity and technology. In his free time, he enjoyed playing various musical instruments and building computers.
<br /><br />
After high school, Eric started working a regular day job with long hours, consistently working 60 hours per week. Despite his busy schedule, he continued to pursue his passion for animation as a moonlight freelance animator. Infact, the long hour day job may have funded the opportunity to move forward with a new career.
<br /><br />
In September 2021, Eric made the decision to take on freelance animation full-time. He was skilled in using programs such as Blender and Animate CC, and was always looking for ways to improve his craft.
<br /><br />
During this time, Eric also developed an interest in programming and decided to start learning more about it. He began by dabbling in C# and Python, using Unreal Engine, Unity, and RPG Maker to create games. The tutorials for creating games are very complex. He quickly became lost in these languages and was less than excited to continue learning more. Perhaps the problem was He starting at expert level, coding polished games, instead of taking the time to learn the basics. Thankfully he learned, eventually.
<br /><br />
In the middle of 2022, Eric decided to fully commit to learning programming and started with HTML and CSS. He quickly became skilled in these languages and moved on to learning JavaScript and React.js. Eric had a particular interest in CSS and CSS frameworks, and his current favorite is Tailwind.
<br /><br />
In his free time, Eric continues to enjoy playing musical instruments and building computers. He also loves spending time with his daughter, playing card games such as Dungeon Mayhem and Munchkins; Or playing Minecraft ( If his daughter can convince him to play )
<br /><br />
Overall, Eric is a dedicated and talented individual with a passion for creativity and technology. He is always looking for ways to improve his skills and pursue his passions, and his dedication to his craft is evident in the quality of his work.
